        NEWS for lazr.restfulclient
        ===========================
        
        0.9.11 (2010-02-11)
        ===================
        
        - If a lazr.restful web service publishes multiple versions, you can
          now specify which version to use in a separate constructor argument,
          rather than sticking it on to the end of the service root.
        - Filenames in the cache will never be longer than 150 characters,
          to avoid errors on eCryptfs filesystems.
        - Added a proof-of-concept test for OAuth-signed anonymous access.
        - Fixed comparisons of entries and hosted files with None.
        
        0.9.10 (2009-10-23)
        ===================
        
        - lazr.restfulclient now requests the correct WADL media type.
        - Made HTTPError strings more verbose.
        - Implemented the equality operator for entry and hosted-file resources.
        - Resume setting the 'credentials' attribute on ServerRoot to avoid
          breaking compatibility with launchpadlib.
        
        0.9.9 (2009-10-07)
        ==================
        
        - The WSGI authentication middleware has been moved from lazr.restful
          to the new lazr.authentication library, and lazr.restfulclient now
          uses the new library.
        
        0.9.8 (2009-10-06)
        ==================
        
        - Added support for OAuth.
        
        0.9.7 (2009-09-30)
        ==================
        
        - Added support for HTTP Basic Auth.
        
        0.9.6 (2009-09-16)
        ==================
        
        - Made compatible with lazr.restful 0.9.6.
        
        0.9.5 (2009-08-28)
        ==================
        
        - Removed debugging code.
        
        0.9.4 (2009-08-26)
        ==================
        
        - Removed unnecessary build dependencies.
        
        - Updated tests for newer version of simplejson.
        
        - Made tests less fragile by cleaning up lazr.restful example filemanager
          between tests.
        
        - normalized output of simplejson to unicode.
        
        0.9.3 (2009-08-05)
        ==================
        
        Removed a sys.path hack from setup.py.
        
        0.9.2 (2009-07-16)
        ==================
        
        - Fields that can contain binary data are no longer run through
          simplejson.dumps().
        
        - For fields that can take on a limited set of values, you can now get
          a list of possible values.
        
        0.9.1 (2009-07-13)
        ==================
        
        - The client now knows to look for multipart/form-data representations
          and will create them as appropriate. The upshot of this is that you
          can now send binary data when invoking named operations that will
          accept binary data.
        
        
        0.9 (2009-04-29)
        ================
        
        - Initial public release
