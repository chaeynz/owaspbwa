            The Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a standard 
			set of protocols developed in the late 1970s by the Defense Advanced Research 
			Projects Agency (DARPA) as a means of communication between different types of 
			computers and computer networks. TCP/IP is the driving force of the Internet, 
			and thus it is the most popular set of network protocols on Earth.

            The two protocol components of TCP/IP deal with different aspects of computer networking.
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Internet Protocol</em></span>, the "IP" of TCP/IP is a 
			connectionless protocol which deals only with network packet routing using the <span class="italics">IP Datagram</span> as the basic unit of networking information.  The 
			IP Datagram consists of a header followed by a message.  The <span class="emphasis"><em>
			Transmission Control Protocol</em></span> is the "TCP" of TCP/IP and enables network hosts 
			to establish connections which may be used to exchange data streams.  TCP also guarantees 
			that the data between connections is delivered and that it arrives at one network host in 
			the same order as sent from another network host.

            The TCP/IP protocol configuration consists of several elements which must be set by

			Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server which in turn, can be configured to provide the 
			proper TCP/IP configuration settings to network clients automatically. These 
			configuration values must be set correctly in order to facilitate the proper network

                  bits significant to the <span class="emphasis"><em>subnetwork</em></span>.  For example,
                  in a Class C network, the standard netmask is 255.255.255.0 which masks the first
                  three bytes of the IP address and allows the last byte of the IP address to

                  the Level3 (Verizon) servers with IP addresses from

              IP routing is a means of specifying and discovering paths in a TCP/IP network along which
              network data may be sent.  Routing uses a set of <span class="emphasis"><em>routing tables</em></span>
              to direct the forwarding of network data packets from their source to the destination, often
              via many intermediary network nodes known as <span class="emphasis"><em>routers</em></span>.
              There are two primary forms of
              IP routing: <span class="emphasis"><em>Static Routing</em></span> and 
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic Routing.</em></span>
            </p>
                <p>
            Static routing involves manually adding IP routes to the system's routing table, and this is usually
            done by manipulating the routing table with the <span class="application"><strong>route</strong></span> command. Static routing enjoys
            many advantages over dynamic routing, such as simplicity of implementation on smaller networks, 
            predictability (the routing table is always computed in advance, and thus the route is precisely the 
            same each time it is used), and low overhead on other routers and network links due to the lack of a
            dynamic routing protocol.  However, static routing does present some disadvantages as well.  For example,
            static routing is limited to small networks and does not scale well.  Static routing also fails completely
            to adapt to network outages and failures along the route due to the fixed nature of the route. 
            </p>
                <p>
            Dynamic routing depends on large networks with multiple possible IP routes from a source to a destination
            and makes use of special routing protocols, such as the Router Information Protocol (RIP), which handle
            the automatic adjustments in routing tables that make dynamic routing possible.  Dynamic routing
            has several advantages over static routing, such as superior scalability and the ability to adapt
            to failures and outages along network routes. Additionally, there is less manual configuration of the
            routing tables, since routers learn from one another about their existence and available routes. This trait
            also eliminates the possibility of introducing mistakes in the routing tables via human error.
            Dynamic routing is not perfect, however, and presents disadvantages such as heightened complexity and
            additional network overhead from router communications, which does not immediately benefit the end users,
            but still consumes network bandwidth.

              TCP is a connection-based protocol, offering error correction and guaranteed delivery of
              data via what is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>flow control</em></span>. Flow control
              determines when the flow of a data stream needs to be stopped, and previously sent data
              packets should to be re-sent due to problems such as <span class="emphasis"><em>collisions</em></span>,
              for example, thus ensuring complete and accurate delivery of the data.  TCP is typically
              used in the exchange of important information such as database transactions. 
            </p>
                <p>
              The User Datagram Protocol (UDP), on the other hand, is a <span class="emphasis"><em>connectionless</em></span>
              protocol which seldom deals with the transmission of important data because it lacks flow
              control or any other method to ensure reliable delivery of the data.  UDP is commonly used
              in such applications as audio and video streaming, where it is considerably faster than
              TCP due to the lack of error correction and flow control, and where the loss of a few packets
			  is not generally catastrophic.

              The Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP) is an extension to the Internet Protocol (IP) as defined
              in the Request For Comments (RFC) #792 and supports network packets containing control, error, and
              informational messages.  ICMP is used by such network applications as the <span class="application"><strong>ping</strong></span>
              utility, which can determine the availability of a network host or device.  Examples of some error messages
              returned by ICMP which are useful to both network hosts and devices such as routers, include 
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Destination Unreachable</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Time Exceeded</em></span>.

              Daemons are special system applications which typically execute continuously in the background and
              await requests for the functions they provide from other applications.  Many daemons are network-centric; that is,
              a large number of daemons executing in the background on an Ubuntu system may provide network-related functionality.
              Some examples of such network daemons include the <span class="emphasis"><em>Hyper Text Transport Protocol Daemon</em></span> 
              (httpd), which provides web server functionality; the <span class="emphasis"><em>Secure SHell Daemon</em></span> (sshd), which
              provides secure remote login shell and file transfer capabilities; and the <span class="emphasis"><em>Internet Message Access 
              Protocol Daemon</em></span> (imapd), which provides E-Mail services.
