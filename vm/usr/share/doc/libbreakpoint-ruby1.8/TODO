* Factor out remote breakpoint support to a separate file so it can be loaded
  on-demand. This would allow the local breakpoint functionality to work even
  when DRb is not available. (E.g. on Debian)

= Done

* breakpoint_client ought to handle the case that Options is already defined
  so that RubyOnRails and other frameworks that might want to ship
  ruby-breakpoint directly can overwrite the default options easily.

* Do further research on the write SecurityError.
  See ruby-core for more information.
  * This seems to have been a bug in Ruby 1.8.1 and early snapshots in Ruby 1.8.2.
    The problem can be fixed by updating to a more current Ruby. More information
    regarding this is available at the Wiki:

    http://ruby-breakpoint.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?FrequentlyAskedQuestions

* Find out whether we need to add Windows and Linux wrappers to the bin/ directory
  * This is handled correctly by RubyGems. setup.rb only copies the .rb file to a
    suitable directory, but that should work in the usual case.

* breakpoint_client needs logic for detecting the default client uri based on the
  server uri:
  * drbunix:/foo/bar => drbunix:#{File.join(Dir.tmpdir, "#{random}.breakpoint")}
    (require 'tmpdir')
  * druby://localhost:port => druby://localhost:#{rand_port}

* Mention available ressources (especially the FAQ) in breakpoint_client --help

* Document drbunix:/ uris and how they are more secure than druby:// with ACLs.
  Suggest that this be used in environments where there are lots of users sharing
  the same system. (E.g. web hosters)
