= ruby-breakpoint 0.5.1 README

ruby-breakpoint lets you inspect and modify state at run time. This allows you
to diagnose bugs, patch applications and more all via IRB by simply doing a
method call at the place you want to investigate.

ruby-breakpoint is integrated into the popular RubyOnRails and Nitro web
development frameworks. In the past it has also been a part of the Ruby
dev-utils Project.

ruby-breakpoint is available from http://ruby-breakpoint.rubyforge.org/ --
that web site also is a good place for discussing new features, filing bug
reports and so on.

See the NEWS file for the changes that were done in this release.
