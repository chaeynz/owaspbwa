# Configuration contained in this file should be included 
# in the MAIN Apache config section as these directives
# can not be included within Virtual Host containers.
#

# Set web server identification string
#
# If you want to spoof another web server type, you can specify it like this -
#
# SecServerSignature "Microsoft-IIS/6.0"
#  or
# SecServerSignature "Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1"
#
# Spoofing the Server token data is considered by some to be "Security by Obscurity"
# and that may be true when it is the *only* security measure taken.  There is
# a security benefit, however, with changing this data and that is to help
# protect against automated banner-grabbing tools, exploit code and worms that
# decide to send the attack payload based on the target platform data in the
# Server token.
#
# For this directive to work, you need to set Apache ServerTokens
# to Full (this is the default option)
#
# The default setting is to server a blank Server banner
SecServerSignature " "

# Add ruleset identity to the logs
#
SecComponentSignature "core ruleset/2.0.3"

# Parameters separator
#
# Specifies which character to use as separator for 
# application/x-www-form-urlencoded content. 
# Defaults to "&". Applications are sometimes (very rarely) written to use 
# a semicolon (";").
#
# NOTE Changing the value for this directive has significant influence on how
#      ModSecurity works. Make the change only if you are absolutely sure it
#      is required.
SecArgumentSeparator "&" 

# Path where persistent data (e.g. IP address data, session data, etc) is to
# be stored. Must be writable by the web server user.
#
# TODO It is advisable to create a directory structure for ModSecurity such as
#      /var/log/msa and create sub directories for SecDataDir, SecTmpDir,
#      SecUploadDir, SecAuditLog and SecAuditLogStorageDir
#      underneath it and set the permission for read and write only by the
#      Apache user.

SecDataDir /tmp

# Create both Global and IP collections for rules to use
SecAction "phase:1,t:none,pass,nolog,initcol:global=global,initcol:ip=%{remote_addr}"
