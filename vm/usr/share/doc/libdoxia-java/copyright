License:
    A number of source files in this package have missing or invalid
    license declarations. Upstream have fixed this in their SVN, and the
    situation discussed in
       http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/07/msg00042.html
    The consensus was that it should not prevent the package
    entering Debian.
