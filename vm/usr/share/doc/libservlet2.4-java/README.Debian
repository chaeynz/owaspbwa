libservlet2.4-java for Debian
-----------------------------

The sources of jsr152 (JSP 2.0) and jsr154 (Servlet API 2.4) come from
Tomcat5. They have been extracted form tomcat5 source package because
libcommons-el-java package needs this API to build and tomcat5 needs
libcommons-el-java (and libservlet2.4-java) to build, so it's easier to
split the source packages.
