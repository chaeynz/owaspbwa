commons-daemon for Debian
-------------------------

While jsvc has support for various Java virtual machines, not all of
them can be enabled at build time. The Debian version supports the
JVMs from the java-gcj-compat and sun-java5-jre packages, but we had
to disable support for Kaffe and SableVM. We hope that this
shortcoming can be fixed in the future.
