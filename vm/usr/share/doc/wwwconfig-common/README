wwwconfig-common for Debian
---------------------------

This package is used by some packages to prevent errors from duplication
and ease the setup of new packages that uses a webserver and some other
tools.

Note! This package will not depend on any packages that are not critical.
So if the package that uses this package to do a certain thing, it should
depend the extra packages that this functionality requires, like mysql-client
and similar. These packages are at most suggested by this package.

If you are packaging applications for apache the debian-apache@lists.debian.org
may be something for you. Also you may want to take a look on an other
approach (not used yet and you should only take some ideas from it). The
directories mentioned there should not be used, for now. The other approach
can be found at:
