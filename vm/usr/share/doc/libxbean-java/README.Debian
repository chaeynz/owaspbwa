libxbean-java
--------------

This package does not contain the following XBean modules as they 
rely on some additional dependencies:
- maven-xbean-plugin
- xbean-classloader
- xbean-spring

I would advise to package those additional modules in a separate package, to 
avoid circular dependencies as Maven uses XBean
