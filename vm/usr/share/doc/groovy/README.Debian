groovy for Debian
-----------------

A few notes for concerning this package:

Build information:

Groovy is normally built via maven, however since maven isn't in Debian
just yet and debian policy requires all dependencies to be on the system
at build time (and not retrieved via a network connection), ant is
currently being used.

The ant file was generated using the maven build files using the 'maven ant' 
task, and was then modified to include some of the extra maven.xml post/pre
goals.

As far as I can tell both builds create the same installables, but please
feel free to let me know if you notice something that is out of sync.

When maven is available in Debian, we can switch over and use it to
perform an offline build.

Version Number:

Currently groovy is a beta, but since the upstream version number contains
a 1.0 in it (1.0beta8) this will be considered a higher version than 1.0
when it's released. For this reason, all beta packages will have a leading
0 in front of their upstream version. This will allow users to ugprade to
1.0 cleanly when it's released.

Dependency information:

Debian java policy prefers all dependencies to be packaged as separate
packages. I've done this for most packages, except those that are CVS cuts,
development versions, or out of date packages. Since these dependencies are
a specific snapshot of what's been used, I've bundled those in this package, 
in the debian/bundled.tar.bz2.uue file.

Over time, as each of these dependencies mature and are officially
released (and groovy adopts them), I'll package them up individually,
unless someone else beats me to it.

The bundled dependencies are:

axion-1.0-M3-dev (development version)
commons-collections-3.0-dev2.jar (development version)
nekohtml-0.7.7 (to be packaged)
openejb-loader-0.9.2 (needs packaging, but is a large package)
qdox-1.3 (to be packaged)
redeox-0.9 (to be packaged)
redeox-oro-0.9 (to be packaged, oro packageok ?)
xerces-2.4 (old version, 2.6 in debian, will this work?)
xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar (old version, 1.1 in debian, part of the xerces package ok?)

Website:

A shallow copy of the Groovy website has been included for offline reading
in the groovy-doc package. The depth of links mirrored has been set to 2,
this means most articles of interest will be in the
/usr/share/doc/groovy-doc/groovy.codehaus.org directory. The main index
page is Home.html (not index.html as normal) due to the structure of the
actual Groovy website itself.

The website is pre-fetched and included in the source package as a
compressed uuencoded file, as part of the debian maintainer diffs. There's
also a 'site' rule that's part of the debian/rules file. To update the
website archive, simply run the 'site' rule, and a new website archive
will be created (fakeroot debian/rules site).

Note that the javadocs which are part of the website, are generated from
the package source code and are not part of the pre-fetched website mirror.

Misc:

Any ideas, thoughts, help, etc with this package is greatly appreciated,
please feel free to contact me if you would like to suggest and
improvements, patches, etc. Thanks for using this package.

Groovy's build is now using Ant and compatible with Maven 2.
I have patched the Ant build to work with Debian, and I'm deploying 
Groovy's jars into the Maven 2 repository for Debian in /usr/share/maven-repo

Documentation is now completely generated from the code, using the Ant build script.
