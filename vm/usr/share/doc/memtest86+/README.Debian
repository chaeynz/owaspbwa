memtest86+ for Debian
---------------------

Binary image is /boot/memtest86+.bin

It is automatically registered against grub2.  For other bootloaders
you'll need to do some manual setup (see examples/grub-menu.lst for
GRUB Legacy or examples/lilo.conf for LILO), or to make a boot-floppy,
and reboot on this image.

The make-memtest86+-boot-floppy utility will help you to create a
boot floppy or floppy image using GRUB Legacy.
