This module contains the Java Access Bridge for GNOME, 
which connects the built-in accessibility support in
Java Swing apps to the GNOME Accessibility framework,
specifically the Assistive Technology Service Provider
Interface (AT-SPI).   Version 1.26.2

Contents:

bridge: directory contains the Java Bridge component which is 
        automatically loaded into each JVM invocation because 
        of an entry in the accessibility.properties file in 
        $JRE_HOME/lib.

        ($JRE_HOME is usually $JDK_HOME/jre).

idlgen: directory into which the auto-generated java wrappers
        for the org.gnome.Accessibility and org.gnome.Bonobo
        IDL are written by the Java IDL compiler, 'idlj'.

impl:   directory where the implementation code for the 
        Java Accessibility Bridge for GNOME resides.  This
        code implements the Java Accessibility API AT-SPI
        interfaces on behalf of Java programs which implement
        the Java Accessibility API (JAAPI) internally; 
	i.e. this implementation code wraps the JAAPI 
        accessibility implementation and exports it via CORBA
	to the bonobo-based GNOME Accessibility
	Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI).

test:   (nothing here yet).
