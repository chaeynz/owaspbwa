libcommons-net2-java for Debian
------------------------------

Commons Net has switch its build process to Maven, but I'm not using Maven 
here as some components of Maven rely on this library.

debian/MANIFEST.MF has been extracted from the official commons-net.jar and
it may need to be updated for new releases.
