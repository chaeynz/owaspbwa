AUTHORS
    The current version of DBD::mysql is almost completely written by
    Jochen Wiedmann, and is now being maintained by Patrick Galbraith
    (patg@mysql.com). The first version's author was Alligator
    Descartes, who was aided and abetted by Gary Shea, Andreas König
    and Tim Bunce amongst others.

    The Mysql module was originally written by Andreas König
    <koenig@kulturbox.de>. The current version, mainly an emulation
    layer, is from Jochen Wiedmann.
