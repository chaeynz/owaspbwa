GNU Autoconf

This package is derived from sources obtained at:
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/autoconf

The Autoconf upstream tarball has been modified by removing most of
the Texinfo documentation.  This is because it is subject to the GNU
Free Documentation License (FDL), which Debian regards as non-free
when invariant sections, such as the front-cover and back-cover texts
in the Autoconf, are included.

Packaged originally by Mark Eichin <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>.
Currently maintained by Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>.

Changes for packaging are licensed under the GNU GPL.

Upstream licensing notice:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Autoconf is released under the General Public License (GPL).
Additionally, Autoconf includes a licensing exception in some of its
source files; see the respective copyright notices for how your
project is impacted by including scripts generated by Autoconf.

This version of Autoconf uses GPLv2+ plus the above-mentioned
exceptions for its installed executables, as described in COPYING.
Meanwhile, several source files within the Autoconf project are under
GPLv3+, as described in COPYINGv3; these files are used for building
and installing Autoconf, but are not present in the installed
programs.  The entire Autoconf project will move to GPLv3+ when the
exception statements have been reformulated in terms of the Additional
Permissions as described in section 7 of GPLv3.

notes as appying to the output of Autoconf, is the following:

Authors of GNU Autoconf.

Autoconf was originally written by David MacKenzie, with help from
Fran√ßois Pinard, Karl Berry, Richard Pixley, Ian Lance Taylor, Roland
McGrath, Noah Friedman, david d zuhn, and many others.

Ben Elliston next took over the maintenance, facing a huge Autoconf
backlog that had been piling up since the departure of David.  Other
maintainers have included Akim Demaille, Jim Meyering, Alexandre
Oliva, and Tom Tromey, with plenty of contributions from Lars J. Aas,
Mo DeJong, Steven G. Johnson, Matthew D. Langston, Pavel Roskin.

Today, the primary maintainers are Paul Eggert and Eric Blake, with
help from Ralf Wildenhues, Stepan Kasal, and Benoit Sigoure.  Many
other people have contributed, as listed in the THANKS file.

The following contributors have warranted legal paper exchanges with
the Free Software Foundation for their contributions to GNU Autoconf.
