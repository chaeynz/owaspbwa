title: Ruby on Rails select_tag Helper Method prompt Value XSS

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack. This flaw exists because input passed via the prompt value is not
  properly sanitized by the select_tag helper method before returning it to
  the user. This may allow a user to create a specially crafted request that
  would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust
  relationship between their browser and the server.
