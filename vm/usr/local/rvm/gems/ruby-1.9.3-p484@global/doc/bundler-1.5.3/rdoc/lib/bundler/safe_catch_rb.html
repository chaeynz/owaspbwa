      <h2>Description</h2>
      
<p>SafeCatch provides a mechanism to safely deepen the stack, performing
stack-unrolling similar to catch/throw, but using Fiber or Thread to avoid
deepening the stack too quickly.</p>

<p>The API is the same as that of catch/throw: SafeCatch#safe_catch takes a
“tag” to be rescued when some code deeper in the process raises it. If the
catch block completes successfully, that value is returned. If the tag is
“thrown” by safe_throw, the tag’s value is returned. Other exceptions
propagate out as normal.</p>

<p>The implementation, however, uses fibers or threads along with raise/rescue
to handle “deepening” the stack and unrolling it. On implementations where
Fiber is available, it will be used. If Fiber is not available, Thread will
be used. If neither of these classes are available, Proc will be used,
effectively deepening the stack for each recursion as in normal
catch/throw.</p>

<p>In order to avoid causing a new issue of creating too many fibers or
threads, especially on implementations where fibers are actually backed by
native threads, the “safe” recursion mechanism is only used every 20
recursions. Based on experiments with JRuby (which seems to suffer the most
from excessively deep stacks), this appears to be a sufficient granularity
to prevent stack overflow without spinning up excessive numbers of fibers
or threads. This value can be adjusted with the BUNDLER_SAFE_RECURSE_EVERY
env var; setting it to zero effectively disables safe recursion.</p>
