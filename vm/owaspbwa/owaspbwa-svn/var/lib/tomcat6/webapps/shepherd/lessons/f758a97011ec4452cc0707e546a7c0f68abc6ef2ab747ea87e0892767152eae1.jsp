		<h2 class="title">What is Mobile Client Side Injection?</h2>
		<p>
		<div id="lessonIntro">

			<br /> <a>Client Side Injection</a> occurs when the user can execute <a>SQLite</a>
			commands through application input in order to change the query run by an App.
			The APK for this lesson encrypts it's databases using <a>AES</a>. It would be
			difficult to steal login details by attacking the encryption but a
			lot easier to use SQL Injection to bypass the login.
			<br />
			<br />
			An ineffective defence against Client Side Injection is <a>Filtering user input</a>.
			This technique involves trying to predict the query which an attacker would execute and then replacing key words like
			SELECT, WHERE, FROM with a dot or blank space. 
			Filtering will make it more difficult for an attacker to exploit an injection flaw but will not stop. 
			<br />
			<br />
			A security system is only as strongest as it's weakest link. We don't
			need to know the user credentials. We do know that the APK uses a
			textbook example of running an SQL query by appending the Username and
			Password to a String in a Select statement in order to verify if a
			Username and Password exist. If this statement returns true, the user
			is logged in.

		Exploit the SQL Injection flaw in this challenges app to bypass the Client Side Login. Once you manage to log in as the admin, you will get the key.
